::: details User Types: Use Case
When you have several projects from different clients, you most likely want that each of your clients could see only those data that they are related with. To achieve this you need to register a new web user as a client. Then you assign a relevant project for this client in the Project Settings section.

::: tip
1. Web user's access levels are project based. 
2. New users by default will not have any access to any project.
3. Grant access to a web user is done from [Project Settings](./04-projects.html#project-settings.md).
