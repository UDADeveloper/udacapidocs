# Mapboard

You can use Mapboard if you collect locational data in your survey form and you activated `Progress map` in [Monitoring preferences](/guide/21-preferences.html##progress-map) page. Mapboard helps you to see the responses for questions with predefined answers as a donut chart on the map.
