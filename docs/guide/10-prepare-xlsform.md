# Prepare XLSForm

XLSForm is a form standard created to help simplify the authoring of forms in Excel. XLSForms are simple to get started with but allow for the authoring of complex forms. Forms designed with Excel can be converted to XForms that can be used with UDACAPI.
To design your form, refer to the [XLSForm form design documentation](http://xlsform.org/).

You can also download a useful MS Excel template of XLSForm from UDACAPI. For this in the **Projects** page click `Upload XLSForm` button under `Actions` column
