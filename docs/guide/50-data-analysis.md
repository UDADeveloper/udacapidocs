# Data analysis

## Pivot table

`Pivot table` provides dynamic cross analysis of questions. These analysis could be a **cross table**, different **charts** or **heatmap** tables, etc.

First select a table, then questions (e.g. variables) from that table

## Descriptive Statistics

This section lets you quickly get some statistical indicators (such as count, mean, median, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, variance, etc.) and a histogram - approximate representation of the distribution for questions with numeric values. For this you should select a table and a question.
