# Dashboard

Dashboard will help you to monitor your data collection process and initially it has no blocks. You should add blocks using [Monitoring preferences](/guide/21-preferences.html#monitoring-blocks).

::: tip Note
Dashboard presents you your survey data in near to real time. If you have any queries marked to be exclude from dataset in [Query Builder](/guide/60-data-processing.html#query-builder), than the results of that query will not be included into the data of these blocks.
